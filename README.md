## Short Description :

Visual-product-matcher is a Python-based tool designed to identify and match visually similar products using deep learning techniques. The system leverages image analysis and machine learning methods to automate the task of product comparison for e-commerce or inventory management applications.

## Brief idea of project approach:

This project implements a deep learning-powered visual matching pipeline to compare and group product images based on their appearance. The approach involves preprocessing product images, extracting visual features using convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and applying similarity measures to group items that look alike. By automating visual similarity matching, the tool aims to speed up product deduplication, cataloging, and competitive analysis in large-scale retail environments. The system prioritizes scalable, accurate feature extraction and leverages open-source Python libraries for easy extensibility and deployment. The matching process is designed to be robust to common variations in product presentation, lighting, and packaging, supporting real-world retail and e-commerce workflows.
